# The NLP and Data Science Team at KIoT
Established in December 2024, the NLP and Data Science team at the Kombolcha Institute of Technology (KIoT) at Wollo University is focused on addressing local challenges through innovative technological solutions specifically tailored to the Ethiopian context. Drawing from a pool of researchers and lecturers within the Faculty of Informatics, the team concentrates on two main areas of expertise: Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Data Science.
## Natural Language Processing (NLP)

The NLP team is committed to developing technologies that better understand and process Ethiopian languages. This effort is bolstered by strategic collaborations with Bahir Dar University and EthioNLP, enhancing the team’s capacity to innovate and adapt technology to local needs. Their primary areas of focus include:

- **Basic Preprocessing for Local Languages:** The team is engaged in creating comprehensive preprocessing pipelines to manage the unique characteristics of Ethiopian languages, covering aspects like text normalization, tokenization, and segmentation. These foundational frameworks are essential for building more advanced NLP systems.

- **Fine-Tuning Large Language Models (LLMs) for Local Languages:** Efforts are underway to adapt and fine-tune cutting-edge LLMs to operate effectively in Ethiopian languages. This includes capturing linguistic subtleties and cultural contexts to enhance the models’ accuracy and applicability.

- **Speech Recognition:** Through partnerships with Bahir Dar University, the team works on fine-tuning models like Whisper to improve speech recognition capabilities for Ethiopian languages. This involves enhancing the accuracy of audio transcription in various local dialects and providing tools that enable better accessibility and information dissemination across language barriers.

## Data Science

The Data Science team explores a variety of AI and data science applications, emphasizing their potential to drive progress in key sectors:

- **Healthcare:**  By utilizing medical data and predictive modeling, the team aims to develop improved diagnostic tools and enhance patient care, contributing to better healthcare outcomes and wider access to services.

- **Agriculture:** The team is applying data science techniques to improve agricultural practices, such as leveraging predictive models for crop yield, conducting soil analyses, and promoting smart farming methodologies to increase productivity and sustainability.

- **Smart City Solutions:** Projects geared towards smart city advancements focus on urban planning improvements, including traffic management and environmental monitoring, to help foster the development of efficient and sustainable urban environments.

- **Finance** 
- **Manufacturing and Industries** 

These collaborative efforts underscore the team's dedication to harnessing advanced technology to address local challenges, fostering an environment of research, collaboration, and community empowerment. Their work at KIoT is pivotal in integrating technology across various facets of life in Ethiopia, paving the way for a more innovative and inclusive future.
